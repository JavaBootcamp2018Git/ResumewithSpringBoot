Build on your challenge from Week 4. 

Done: Add a new role for recruiters. Recruiters should be able to post jobs and add desired skills to each job.

When applicants log in, they should be able to see jobs that match their skills. 

Each job should be associated with an organization, so that the candidate can search for jobs by organization.
